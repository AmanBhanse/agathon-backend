    "in the scope of the amendment was triggered by the authroisation of \nnumerous CDK4/6 inhibitors.  \nIn versions 4.1 to 4.3, no content -related changes were made (see see chapter 1.6). \nVersion 4.0  (2017)  \nThe recommendations contained in the chapter on patient infeormation and \nEductaion have been expanded and adpated to the information needs of the patients \n(see chapter 3.2) \nEarly Detection (previously a separate S3 Practice Guideline) has been incorporated \nherein: Specific recommendation s therein describe the approach to be used in \npatients with a high breast density and how to handle specific examination \nprocedures (e.g. tomosynthesis) (see Chapter 3.2).  \nIn the past years, a growing amount of data has become available on women with an \nelevated familial or genetic predispositi",
    "sis) (see Chapter 3.2).  \nIn the past years, a growing amount of data has become available on women with an \nelevated familial or genetic predisposition and on the cancer occurrence in such \nspecial settings. In other words, the recommendations give explicit instructions and \noptions on how to proceed (e.g. platinum -containing systemic therapy, counseling \nservices a nd dealing with the increased lifetime risk of further malignancies) (see \nChapter 3.3).  \nThe Diagnostics chapter contains new recommendations on staging alongside the \nconventional breast -related gynecological examinations. For example, a CT scan of \nthe che st and abdomen is now explicitly recommended in patients with a high risk of \nrecurrence or metastases (see Chapter 4.1).  \nIn the current version, Chapter 4.4 Surgica",
    " now explicitly recommended in patients with a high risk of \nrecurrence or metastases (see Chapter 4.1).  \nIn the current version, Chapter 4.4 Surgical treatment of invasive carcinoma takes into \naccount more modern surgical procedures and th e method applied to axillary \nstaging, while particularly focusing on the growing use of neoadjuvant therapies. \nOverall, the new recommendations are intended to reduce radical surgeries \n(narrowing the safety margin in the resection of invasive carcinoma, om itting axillary \ndissection under pre -defined conditions).  \nThe recommendations on pathomorphological examinations also include more recent \nmarkers. This Guideline also counts Ki67 among the conventional prognostic factors \nand allows the use of multigene ass ays in defined settings (see Chapt",
    "ers. This Guideline also counts Ki67 among the conventional prognostic factors \nand allows the use of multigene ass ays in defined settings (see Chapter 4.5). \nAs in the surgical setting, the recommendations on radiotherapy increasingly follow \nde-escalation strategies: Procedures like hypofractionation and partial breast \nradiation  alone can be discussed with the patien ts, especially those with advanced \nage (see Chapter 4.6).  \n1.1 Editors   \n© German Guideline Program in Oncology | Evidence -based Guideline Breast Cancer - V4.4 | May 2021  1 \nThe updated S3 Practice Guideline outlines in detail the options for adjuvant \nendocrine therapy, including that of prolonged administration (5 -10 years) and the \nadministration of chemotherapies (se e Chapter 4.7).  \nNew recommendations regardi",
    ", including that of prolonged administration (5 -10 years) and the \nadministration of chemotherapies (se e Chapter 4.7).  \nNew recommendations regarding influenceable lifestyle factors are designed to \nincrease patients’ physical activity and weight loss in order to lower their risk of \nrecurrence and heighten their subjective well -being (see Chapter 4.7.7 ).  \nThe updated Guideline also gives clear recommendations relating to settings with \nmetastasis and local recurrences: In patients with local recurrences, for example, \noptions for repeated radiotherapy and reinduction of cytostatics should be evaluated \nbesides c omplete resection (see Chapters 5.3 and 5.4). \nIn addition to the previous and now updated chapters from the 2012 Guideline, new \nchapters have been developed by the authors",

Objectives of the Guideline Program for Oncology  \nWith the German Guideline Program in Oncology, the Association of the Scientific \nMedical Societies in Germany (AWMF), the German Cancer Society (DKG), and the \nGerman Cancer Aid (DKH) have set themselves the task of jointly promoting and \nsupporting the development, updating and use of scientifically founded and practicable \nguidelines in oncology. The program is based on medical -scientific knowledge of the \nprofessional s ocieties and the DKG, the consensus of medical experts, users and \npatients, as well as regulations of the guideline preparation of the AWMF and the expert \n",
    "s and the DKG, the consensus of medical experts, users and \npatients, as well as regulations of the guideline preparation of the AWMF and the expert \nsupport and funding by the German Cancer Aid. To map current medical knowledge \nand account for progre ss in the field of medicine, guidelines have to be reviewed and \nupdated regularly. The AWMF Guidance Manual forms the basis for the development of \nhigh-quality oncologic guidelines. As guidelines constitute an important quality \nassurance and quality manage ment tool in oncology, they should be incorporated \nspecifically and consistently into routine care. Active implementation measures and \nevaluation programs are therefore an important component in promoting the Guideline \nProgram in Oncology. The objective of  the program is to create p",
    "evaluation programs are therefore an important component in promoting the Guideline \nProgram in Oncology. The objective of  the program is to create professional and \nmedium -term financially secure preconditions for the development and production of \nhigh-quality guidelines in Germany. These high -quality guidelines serve not only the \nstructured transfer of knowledge, but may als o find their place in health care system \nstructures. Worth mentioning here are evidence -based guidelines as the basis for \npreparing and updating disease management programs or for implementing guideline -\nderived quality indicators (QIs) for the certificatio n of organ cancer centers.  \n1.9 Additional  Documents relating to this Guideline   \n© German Guideline Program in Oncology | Evidence -based Guideline B",

In addition, an editorial and content \nreview and revision of the core statements and recommendations of the guideline is \nrequired at regular intervals. The objectives of t he S3 guideline for the early detection, \ndiagnosis, therapy and aftercare of breast cancer were retained from the original \nversion and the first two updates and supplemented or specified for the third new \nedition:  \n• Consideration of current findings of evide nce-based medicine and recognised \ntreatment concepts  \n• consideration of the findings from disseminated guidelines and the comprehensive \ncoverage of guideline -based quality indicators in the updatin",

    "goal for which there is a clear potential for improvement. It is a \nprerequisite for empowering women to participate in therapy decisions. At present, \ninformation is increasingly being made available on the Internet, but in many cases \nwith very varying, sometimes unacceptable quality. Particularly in the area of breast \ncancer, a flood of i nformation and educational material is available, the quality of which \nis predominantly assessed as poor. Within the framework of the OL -program, different \nversions of the patient guideline have been created, which are regularly adapted after \nthe correspon ding updates.

The mortality rate after diagnosis of DCIS is partly due to cases with \nundiscovered occult invasion or microinvasion [ 240], and partly to invasive tumor \nrecurrence or ipsilateral second cancers which may occur many years after diagnosis \nof DCIS [ 241].

Among these parameters, grading is  the \nmost important risk factor [ 244], followed by lesion size and detection of comedotype \nnecrosis [ 246]. It could be shown that the group of patients with high -grade DCIS and \nextensive comedotype necroses in > 50 % of ductuli has a sign ificantly increased risk \nof both ipsilateral invasive and non -invasive tumor recurrence [ 250]. The role of gene \nexpression analysis in this context has not yet been conclusively clarified.

A replacement of the axilla dissection by radiotherapy of the axilla can be \nconsidered as an alternative.  \nPatients with micrometastases in the SLN should not be recommended for axillary \ndissection because there i s no evidence for an increased regional risk of local \nrecurrence [ 407]. \nPatients who undergo a mastectomy or who do not undergo postoperative radiotherapy \nof the affected breast are usually",

In Germany, the Insema \nStudy (LKP: Prof. Dr. Th. Reimer, sponsored by the DKH) is currently being conducted \nto prospectively identify patients who can do without axillary staging.

    "ith primary systemic therapy (PST), the optimal procedure in the \narea of lymphatic outflow pathways has not been conclusively clarified. A distinction \nmust be made between women who primarily have clinically (palpatory and \nsonographic) inconspicuous lymph nodes and those whose nodal status is primarily \nclassified as suspicious.  \nWomen with a clinically unremarkable lymph node status benefit from axillary staging \nafter PST. They avoid surgery (before PST) and possible follow -up therapies for clinically \noccult, positive lymph nodes that are successfully treated by systemic therapy [ 418].

The \nfeasibility (detection rate) as well as the accuracy (false negative rate) seem to be \ncomparable in this collective with primarily operated patients [ 408]. \nIn patients without clinical and/or imaging suspicion of axillary metastasis and in whom \nPST is planned, SLNB can therefore be performed either before or after PST.

In the case of a confirmed primary lymph node involvement, the success \nrates of SLNB (detection rate, false negative rate) after PST are clearly limited [ 410], \n[411]. Therefore , an axilla dissection after PST is recommended for these patients.  \nNewer procedures that could possibly lead to an improved detection and accuracy of \nSLNB (in primarily nodal -positive patients) after PST, such as the clip or seed marking \n[419], are currently still insufficiently evaluated and cannot be recommended for \nclinical routine.  \nSufficient data regarding the locoregional risk of recurrence of an SLNB aft",

In particular, it is not cl ear whether the unfavourable false negative \nrate of SLNB after PST in women with primary positive nodal status translates into an \nincreased rate of locoregional recurrence or unfavourable overall survival.  \nIn view of the insufficient information available,  the conduct of clinical studies on this \nissue and the encouragement of suitable patients to participate in these studies are \nexpressly supported.  \n4.5 Pathomorphological  examination   \n© German Guideline Program in Oncology | Evidence -based Guideline Breast Cancer - V4.4 | May 2021  96 \n4.5.

Expansion of intraductal tumor component  \nIf the invasive  carcinoma is accompanied by an intraductal component that extends \nbeyond the border of the invasive carcinoma, not only the distance of the invasive \ncarcinoma but also the distance of the intraductal component to the nearest resection \nedges should be give n in mm.  \nThe evidence for the fact that with a negative resection margin (\"no ink on tumor\"/no \ncolor on the tumor), an extensive intraductal component (EIC) is associated with ",
    "he fact that with a negative resection margin (\"no ink on tumor\"/no \ncolor on the tumor), an extensive intraductal component (EIC) is associated with an \nincreased risk of local recurrence is contradictory and depends on the defini tion of the \nEIC [ 435], [436], [437]. The presence of an EIC is associated with a significantly \nincreased risk of local recurrence if the siz e of the intraductal tumor component in one \ndimension is at least twice the size of the invasive carcinoma [ 437]. It is therefore \nappropriate to apply this definition and to indicate the presence of such an EIC.  \nIn addition, significant DCIS residuals are found more frequently in patients with EIC \nwith positive or dense resection margins in post -resectates than in patients without EIC \n[438].

Therefore, the guidelines of the Soc iety of Surgical Oncology (USA) and the \nAmerican Society for Radiation Oncology also recommend that postoperative \nmammography should be considered in micro calcified EIC -positive carcinomas, as \nresidual calcifications would justify a post -excision [ 435]. It is also pointed out that the \ncharacteristics of young age and several narrow resection margins in patients with EIC -\npositive carcinoma are associated with an increased local recurrence risk.

Rather, it can be \nassumed that the level of the optimal cut -off value is context -dependent, i.e. influenced \nby the composition of the study collective, the molecular tumor types and the \ntherapeutic agents. The decision for a neoadjuvant therapy is mainly controlled by the \nhormone receptor and HER2 status. Triple -negative and HER2 -positive carcinomas are \nusually treated neoadjuvantly. In this situation the Ki -67 level is no longer necessarily \nrelevant. Therefore, the majority of the S3 guideline group decided against a \nrecommendation of Ki -67 as a predictive factor for the response to n eoadjuvant \nsystemic therapy.  \nTumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) can be understood as an immunological \nbiomarker.

A meta -\nanalysis including 13,100 patients from 23 studies concluded that an increased \nnumber of TIL s predicts the achievement of pCR and is associated with an improved \nsurvival rate [ 572].

In this respect, the question remains open as to the \nextent to which surgery and radiation therapy are requ ired after complete remission \nafter neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  \nThe challenge for radiotherapy lies in the decision which patients after NAC followed \nby mastectomy will benefit from post -mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT). Ultimately, this \ndecision is subject to  numerous (additional) influences. At present, the current data \nsituation tends to favour an extension of the indication for PMRT to nodal positive \n4.6 Adjuvant  radiothepary of breastc ancer   \n© German Guideline Program in Oncology | Evidence -based Guideline Breast Cancer - V",

Thus, this approach represents another treatment option.  \nIn case of tumor re -progression, antiestrogens, estrogen receptor antagonists, and \nfinally high -dose progestogens or estrogens can be used  [1065 ], [1066 ]. \nAromatase inhibitor treatment is associated with a significant increase in side effects \ninduced by hormone withdrawal  [1067 ]. During aromatase inhibitor therapy, fewer hot \nflashe s, thromboembolic events, and endometrial cancer occur as side effects \ncompared with tamoxifen, but the rate of arthralgias and myalgias is increased. \nFurthermore, higher bone density loss and possibly a higher rate of osteoporotic \nfractures are to be expe cted.

The main therapy modalities \ninclude resection, radiosurgery, fractional radiotherapy, e.g. as stereotactically guided, \nlocalized radiotherapy or as whole brain radiation, and drug therapy of tumors. When \nassess ing the effect of local therapies in clinical trials, it should be noted that median \nsurvival time is not only influenced by the effectiveness of the treatment of brain \nmetastases, but also by the consequences of systemic tumor progression.  \nSurgery: Surger y has a safe v",

Furthermore, the neuropathic pain can significantly impair the patient's \nquality of life. Motor neuropathy of the proximal muscle group is r arely seen.  \nAfter completion of the therapy, symptoms usually disappear within a few months.  \nRisk factors include an existing neuropathy (e.g. diabetic, alcohol toxic, renal \ninsufficiency), increased age, combination therapies with platinum derivatives (e. g. \ncisplatin > 300 mg/m², grade I -II 14-63%, grade III -IV 7-21%), eribulin (grade I -IV up to \n35%, grade III -I",

With regard to the taxa nes docetaxel, paclitaxel and nab -\npaclitaxel are used. Thus, the supportive therapy of neurotoxicity is particularly \nrelevant for breast cancer patients.  \n6.3.8.1.  Taxane -associated neuropathy  \nTypically, neuropathy is more frequent under paclitaxel than under doce taxel (sensory \nneuropathy grade III/ IV: 2 -33% versus 1 -9%; motor neuropathy grade III/ IV: 0 -14% \nversus 1 -9%) [ 1369 ].

It occurs less frequently under the weekly administration of \npaclitaxel than under the three -weekly administration (grade III/ IV: 19% versus 12%, \np=0.001) [ 1370 ]. Sensory neuropathy occurs more frequently under nab -paclitaxel than \nunder standard paclitaxel. In a study by Gradishar et al. a third degree sensory \nneuropathy was observed significantly more frequently with 10% than under paclitaxel \nwith 2% (p<0,001) [ 1371 ].

Therefore, prevention and early detection of CIPN have the \nhighest priority [ 1375 ].

While deficiencies should be compensated, the data do not show sufficient \nevidence for the general supportive use of selenium (Cochrane: Dennert et al. 2006 \n[1507 ]). There are no meaningful studies specifically on the use of selenium in breast \ncancer. Long -term selenium admini stration should only be carried out under \nconsecutive serum level control.

Chi et al (2013) found a better overall survival based on 5 \ncohorts, especially in ER -negative, ER+/PR+ and postmenopausal patients. It remains \nunclear whether this is particularly or exclusively valid for Asian women. Since the \nunderlying st udies are observational studies in which the compared populations differ \nin terms of socio -demographic parameters (ethnicity, education, age) and no data are \navailable on known confounders (e.g. smoking), these results are not evidence of the \neffect of soy  products in women after treated breast cancer.

There is an international consensus to increase the knowledge \nbase on breast cancer in men by participating in registry studies [ 1605 ], [1609 ], [1610 ]. \nIn male breast cancer patients a similar breast cancer mortality rate is found as in older \npostmenopausal women. A genetic disposition is more frequent in men, especially \nmutation BRCA1 and BRCA2 [ 1611 ]. Furthermore, men with breast cancer have an up \nto 20% increased risk constellation for second malignancies [ 1612 ]. \nOver 90% of patients are diagnosed with ER -positive invasive ductal carcinoma.

A recent \nstudy found 97% ER -positive and only 10% HER2 -positive tumors in a unicentric cohort \nof 61 invasive mammary carcinomas in men [ 1613 ]. 39 -95% of the cases showed \nandrogen receptor expression. In contrast to the histopathological similarities to breast \ncancer in women, molecular biological examinations show signi ficant differences in \n[1607 ], [1608 ], [1610 ], [1613 ]. \nMost men have so far been treated by mastectomy and axillary lymphonodectomy \n(ALND) and possibly with chest wall radiation  [1601 ], [1614 ], [1615 ] Current data \nsuggest in particular less radical surgical measure",

The use of \naromatase inhibitors in adjuvant therapy is not recommended; aromatase inhibitors \nwere associated with a significantly increased mortality in a retrospectiv e analysis of \nGerman cancer registries [ 1622 ]. \nThere is no evidence from clinical studies on the treatment of HER2 -positive breast \ncancer in men; however, there is consensus that, following the successes in HER2 -\npositive breast canc er in women, men with HER2 -positive breast cancer should also be \ntreated adjuvantly with trastuzumab [ 1623 ]. \nIn metastasis, aromatase inhibitors can be used second -line, most likely in combination \nwith drug suppre",

The aim of their use is the continuous \nimprovement of care by presenting the results of care, reflecting them critically and \nimproving them if necessary.

This group created the final set of quality indicators based on the existin g \nquality indicators of the 2012 guideline and the new strong recommendations (strength \nof recommendation A, \"should\") of the updated guideline. The compilation took into \naccount the results of the existing quality indicators from the certified breast canc er \ncenters of the German Cancer Society and the German Society for Senology [ 1551 ], the \nquality indicators of the external inpatient quality assurance [ 1634 ] and the results of \nthe research for existing national and international QIs.

The results of the guideline -\nbased quality indicators, which are measured and evaluated in the certification \nprocedure, were already presented at t he kick -off meeting of the present update in \norder to be able to make changes to recommendations and background texts based on \nthe results from the care system, if necessary. Changes were made for some of the \nrecommendations underlying the existing indicat ors. The changes are mainly due to \nnew study results. The exact procedure for selecting potential QIs and the composition \nof the working group is described in the guideline report  (http://leitlinienprogramm -\nonkologie.de/index.php?id=67ype=0 ). \nAfter",
    "d the composition \nof the working group is described in the guideline report  (http://leitlinienprogramm -\nonkologie.de/index.php?id=67ype=0 ). \nAfter a face -to-face meeting, a written evaluation of the indicators positively prioritized \nthere and a concluding conference call of the working group, 2 new indicators were \nadopted (supplement for QI 5 \"Indication for sentinel lymph node biopsy\" and QI 6 \n\"Therapy of axillary lymph drainage areas in pN1\"). The already existing QI 5 \"Indication \nfor sentinel lymph node biopsy\" will in future be calculated separately for female ( 5 a)) \nand male patients (5 b)) on the basis of the data of the QA procedure for breast surgery \nof the Institute for Quality Assurance and Transparency in Health Care (IQTIG), so that \nonly 1 QI will be added to the a",

This rather descriptive  category includes lesions that are neoplastic by current \nstandards and are also known as \"clinging carcinoma\" of the monomorphic type, \natypical cystic lobules, atypical lobules type A, columnar cell metaplasia with atypia or \ncolumnar cell hyperplasia with  atypia.

The affected \nextended lobules often contain secreted material and microcalcifications.  \nIf an FEA is diagnosed in the pu nch or vacuum biopsy, this change must be assigned \nto category B3 (see also Chapter 5.3.3  Risk lesions).  \nAs described above, FEA is usually a columnar cell alteration with or without \nhyperplasia, w ith low to moderate cytological atypia.

A less pronounced \ninfestation corresponds to an ALH. The determination of the extension and thus the \ndifferentiation between ALH and LCIS is usually only possible on surgical specimens \nbut not on punch biopsies.  \nAs a special feature of the LN, its frequent multicentric (46 -85 %) and bilateral \noccurrence (30 -67 %) must be noted.

If it is not possible to decide on the punch \nor vacuum biopsy material whether small cell epithelial proliferation in TDLUs and/or \nducts should be cla ssified as LN or DCIS, a higher B category: B4 or B5 is recommended. \nThe variants of the LN (especially pleomorphic variant and classical LN with \ncomedonecroses) are classified as B5a.

Tumor residuals \ncan be scattered as small tumor foci in the area of the former tumor bed. Since the 7th \nedition of the TNM Classification (AJCC/UICC), the ypT classification should be based \non the largest coherent tum or focus without inclusion of fibrosis areas. If several tumor \nfoci are present, this is indicated by the suffix \"m\" (e.g. ypT1b(m)).
