## üöÄ Endpoint Details

### Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/getCombinedReport
```

### Input

Request body with:

- `fallnummer`: Case number (string)
- `data`: Patient data dictionary containing:
  - Tumor diagnosis, history, imaging findings
  - Clinical and pathological staging (TNM)
  - Histology/cytology results
  - Secondary diagnoses
  - Prior therapies
  - Treatment approach (curative/palliative)

### Output

JSON response with:

- `fallnummer`: The case number
- `clinical_report`: AI-generated comprehensive clinical summary
- `timestamp`: Report generation timestamp
- `message`: Status message

---

## üìä Report Generation

The endpoint generates a structured clinical report including:

1. **Tumor History** - Patient demographics and case background
2. **Imaging Findings** - Key imaging results
3. **Clinical Staging** - TNM clinical stage (cT, cN, cM, UICC)
4. **Pathological Staging** - TNM pathological stage (pT, pN, pM, UICC)
5. **Missing Information** - Identifies data gaps
6. **Final Assessment** - Comprehensive case summary (5-10 sentences)

## üß™ Testing

### Test 1: Sample Data

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/getCombinedReport \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fallnummer": "18693120",
    "data": { ... }
  }'
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ PASSED - Generated comprehensive clinical report

### Test 2: Real Data Integration

```bash
# Fetch data from fallnummer API and pipe to report endpoint
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/fallnummer/18717770 | \
  jq -c '{fallnummer: .fallnummer, data: .data}' | \
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/getCombinedReport \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @-
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ PASSED - Successfully generated report for case 18717770

## üìà Example Response

### Case 18717770 Generated Report

```
**Tumor History:** Ms. Mustermensch, a 62-year-old female, was diagnosed with
right-sided breast cancer and a nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung,
suspected to be a high-grade non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with
extensive lymph node involvement. She undergoes comprehensive staging with
advanced imaging modalities.

**Imaging Findings:** CT chest/abdomen shows a right-sided breast mass
measuring 2.5 cm with suspicious right axillary lymphadenopathy. Left upper
lobe pulmonary nodule is highly suspicious for malignancy, measuring 1.8 cm
with spiculated margins. No evidence of distant metastases to liver, adrenal
glands, or bones detected on current imaging. **Clinical Staging:** cT2cN3cM0,
UICC Stage IIIC. **Pathology Results:** Breast carcinoma - Invasive ductal
carcinoma (IDC), Grade III (Bloom-Richardson scale). Estrogen receptor (ER)
positive, Progesterone receptor (PR) negative, Her2 equivocal. Histology of
pulmonary lesion pending. **Treatment Approach:** Palliative with extensive
comorbidities noted. **Palliative Connection:** Not connected to palliative
care services yet.

**Final Assessment:** This is a complex case of a 62-year-old female with
synchronous primary malignancies: stage IIIC right-sided breast cancer with
extensive lymph node involvement and a suspicious left lung nodule highly
concerning for secondary malignancy or pulmonary metastasis. The patient's
advanced stage with extensive nodal disease and potential pulmonary involvement
warrants urgent multidisciplinary team conference. Palliative care consultation
is strongly recommended to align treatment goals with patient preferences and
optimize supportive care. Lung biopsy is essential to confirm diagnosis and
inform prognosis. Current therapy: No prior therapeutic interventions noted.

## üîÑ Frontend Integration

The frontend integrates with this endpoint via the `useCombinedReport` hook:

```javascript
const { report, loading, error, isCached } = useCombinedReport(fallnummer, caseData, forceRefresh);
```

### Features

- **Report Caching**: Reports are cached in Zustand store by fallnummer to avoid repeated API calls
- **Force Refresh**: Optional `forceRefresh` parameter to bypass cache and regenerate
- **Status Indicators**: UI shows "AI Generated" badge and "Cached" badge when applicable
- **Regenerate Button**: "Regenerate Report" button on Reports page for manual refresh

---

## ‚ú® Summary

The `/getCombinedReport` endpoint successfully integrates Azure OpenAI capabilities into the tumor board system, providing instant AI-generated clinical summaries that help physicians quickly understand complex case presentations. The endpoint is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, deterministic output, and full frontend integration including intelligent caching for optimal performance.
